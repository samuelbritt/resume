2012
Xen Asynchronous Split-Driver Simulator, Class Project, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA.
 * In a group, developed a multithreaded, multiprocess Linux application in C to simulate shared memory ring buffers used for asynchronous IO in Xen.

2012–2013
Teaching Assistant, Database Systems, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA.
 * Held one-on-one meetings in class of over 240 students to teach high-level concepts such as entity-relationship data modeling, as well as technical help in implementing database-driven applications using MySQL and PHP.

2009–2011
Post-Graduate Research, Materials Simulation, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA.
 * Studied the mechanical response and texture evolution of α+β titanium alloys via multiscale modeling and simulation.
 * Developed new, thermally activated constitutive model based on unique properties of the titanium microstructure.
 * Implemented crystal plasticity material model in FORTRAN to enhance finite element simulation software.
 * Built microstructure generation code and post-processing routines using C++, MATLAB, and Python.
 * Presented results regularly at the meetings of the Center for Computational Materials Design.
 * Administered the Red Hat Linux computer clusters used by all students in the research group.

2005–2009
Engineering Co-op, Composites Research, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL.
 * Five terms as an engineering co-op, performing high-temperature materials research for the aerospace industry.
